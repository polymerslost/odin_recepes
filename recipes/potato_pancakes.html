<h3>Description</h3>
<p>How do you expect me to describe Potato Pankcakes, it's quite literall innit. Like pancakes. From potatoes. Cause whoever came up with this thing was kinda poor. Good with sour cream. Very heavy on calories. Somewhat labour-intensive to make if you don't buy the prefabricated ones. Otherall 8/10, simple and delicious</p>

    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Beat eggs, flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl; stir in potatoes and onion. </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of potato mixture into hot oil in batches. Press to flatten. Cook until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining potato mixture. </li>
